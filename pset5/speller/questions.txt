1.  getrusage() returns the resource usage of a process
2.  16 members
3.  If we pass by value, a lot of memory and time will be wasted and will render getrusage's results less accurate
since copying in the two structures will also take up time and resources.
4.  After first loading in the text file to be checked as well as the dictionary, the function will start
iterating through the text creating words by adding symbols and stopping when it reaches a non alphabetical symbol. It then uses
the check function to see if this word is in the dictionary before continuing to iterate through the text file.

that isn't a letter. If we used fscanf, it would stop at any white space and we would have commas and other punctuation in the words we collected,
making the spellchecker inaccurate.
6. We declared them as const so they can't be modified
