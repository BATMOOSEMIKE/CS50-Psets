1.  stdint.h is a header file that provides a set of typedefs, allowing you to to specify integer types with exact widths (in bytes/bits)
2.  You can fill up a predetermined amount of space in the file
3.  BYTE is 1 byte, DWORD is 4 bytes, LONG is 4 bytes, WORD is 2 bytes
4.  The first two bytes must be 0x424d
5.  bfSize is the size in bytes of the file while biSize is the size of the info header
6.  If biHeight is negative, it means the bmp file is a top down DIB with the origin at the top left
7.  biBitCount specifies the color depth
8.  fopen will return NULL if it can't find the file
9.  The argument specifies how many elements you want to read. We are always reading one element.
10. The padding added on to the scanline makes it a multiple of 4, and since 3*3 is 9, the padding required is 3.
11. fseek will skip the padding
12. SEEK_CUR is an integer constant which can be used as the whence argument for fseek to tell it that the offset provided is relative to the end of the file.
